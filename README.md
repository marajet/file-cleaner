# file-cleaner
A simple script that presents the user with files one by one and provides the option of deleting them

Works on Windows. Download main.py, run it, and input the absolute file path of the directory you'd like to clean.
The program will go through the files of that directory one by one, display the file name, and give you the option to
open it, delete it, or skip it. Open the file if you'd like to see the contents before deleting it. Any deletions
are permanent. Enter q or quit at any time to exit.
